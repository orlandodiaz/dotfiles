# Installation

It's recommended you use the setup.py to install your dotfiles.

Otherwise:
Create symbolic links to these files pointing to your home directory. Note: Don't use relative paths as this will cause symlinks to fail.

```
ln -s /Users/orr/code/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/
ln -s /Users/orr/code/dotfiles/.inputrc ~/
ln -s /Users/orr/code/dotfiles/.vim ~/
ln -s /Users/orr/code/dotfiles/.bash_profile ~/
```
